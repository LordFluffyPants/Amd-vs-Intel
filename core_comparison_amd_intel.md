Processor performance does vary, as previously discussed, even when the processors being compared clock at the same speed. The number of cores on a processor does in part influence this.

A processor having multiple cores is a topic in conversations about high performance. But while a high number of cores sounds beneficial towards achieving higher performance, how well it runs is heavily influenced by how well the core's applications are optimized to make use of its extra cores.
