####Introduction

Why are there perfomance differences when comparing AMD and Intel processors that are clocked at the same speed?
Comparison results between AMD and Intel chips show significant performance differences between the two kinds of chips, even when both chips tested have the same clock speed.

The heart of this issue is more easily examined by breaking down each chip into its bare structure and architecture.
