	While it may be accurate to say that usefulness of benchmarks may be dubious, especially from a consumer’s standpoint, it is clear that the issues lie within how the benchmarks are used. It may be due to improperly optimized instruction sets for a given architecture or failing to account for differing operating systems. Additional problems arise with benchmarks when failing to account for the number of cores contained within a given CPU, not to mention that often benchmarks give seemingly arbitrary numbers to associate with performance while giving no concrete feedback to the user to indicate what a given number signifies, or what the difference of two numbers indicates. Analyzing results of benchmarks seems to indicate that rather than relying on the word of a benchmark, which may or may not be produced by individuals who have an agenda to show that a specific brand of microprocessor outperforms its’ competitor, it is better to look more at specific details about the processor, the stronger metrics being the rate at which the processor clocks at, and how many cores form the processor has. When studying clock rates of processors as a benchmark, it is important to keep in mind that two different processors which clock at the same exact speed do not always benchmark at the same value, however clock speed is an crucial metric when analyzing the quality of a CPU, while the exact clock rate may not make a difference between two processors that clock at three gigahertz a three gigahertz processor will always almost always outperform a CPU with a clock rate of two gigahertz. Frequently the reason for two separate microprocessors with the same clock rate performing differently is a result of the number of cores the processor has, while it may not be as strong of an indicator of power as clock rate, processors with more core will perform better than ones with less cores, and a greater number of physical core impacts performance more positively than the impact of virtual cores. Ultimately the difference between AMD and Intel comes down to a matter of personal preference, both brands make similar products for similar prices; either company provides a quality product
