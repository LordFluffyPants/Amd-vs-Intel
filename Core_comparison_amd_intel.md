Processor performance does vary, as previously discussed, even when the processors being compared clock at the same speed. The number of cores on a processor does in part influence this.

A processor having multiple cores is a topic in conversations about high performance. But, while a high number of cores sounds beneficial towards achieving a higher performance, how efficiently it runs is heavily influenced by how well applications are optimized to make use of the extra cores on the processor.

From an average sample size of 331, an Intel Core i7-4771 @ 3.50GHz is compared against an AMD FX-9590 Eight-Core. Both chips contain 4 physical cores, with each core accounting for two virtual cores, bringing the total to 8 cores.
