Processor performance does vary, as previously discussed, even when the processors being compared clock at the same speed. The number of cores on a processor does in part influence this.

A processor having multiple cores is a topic in conversations about high performance. But, while a high number of cores sounds beneficial towards achieving a higher performance, how efficiently it runs is heavily influenced by how well applications are optimized to make use of the extra cores on the processor.

From an average sample size of 331, an Intel Core i3-4350 @ 3.60GHz is compared against an AMD FX-9590 Eight-Core in terms of performance and value. Both chips contain 4 cores, with the intel chip containing 2 physical and 2 virtual cores, and the AMD chip containing 4 physical cores. Both chips are priced closely. In terms of performance, the AMD chip with 4 physical cores receives a performance score that is twice of the Intel chip containing 2 physical cores and 2 virtual cores. 

Performance for these chips is measured in terms of efficiency performing mathematical operations, compression, encryption, and SSE.

To further expand, from an average sample size of 5 , an Intel Xeon X3460 @ 2.80GHz is compared with an Intel Core i3-4350 @ 3.60GHz. A close to similar performance benchmark is shown for both chips despite their differing amount of cores reinstating a conclusion that the number of cores does not always determine whether a processor will outperform another one.
